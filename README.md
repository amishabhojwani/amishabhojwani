Hey everyone! I’m @amishabhojwani, a quantitative researcher with a background in computational biology and statistical programming.

- 👀 I’m interested in the power of data to drive decision making in a business context.
- 🌱 Constant and consistent learning are a big part of data science. I'm working on my goal of improving the use of statistical and machine learning tools I have acquired through my studies to achieve meaningful insights from data with every experience that comes my way.
- 💞️ I’m looking for positions or projects which can expand my breadth of expertise as a data professional.
- 📫 Aside from data, data, data... I like scooba diving, hiking, baking and playing the piano.

✨ Feel free to browse through my projects ✨
