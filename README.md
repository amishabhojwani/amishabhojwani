Hey everyone! I’m @amishabhojwani, a quantitative scientist with a background in computational biology.

- 👀 I’m interested in the power of data to drive decision making, be it in conservation or more business-tailored settings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the statistical and machine learning tools I have acquired through my studies to achieve meaningful insights from data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which can expand my worldvision. In the process of looking for a job that will help me grow as a professional in data science.
- 📫 Aside from data, data, data... I like scooba diving, hiking, baking and playing the piano.

✨ Feel free to browse through my projects ✨
